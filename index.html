      Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of
      Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became
      an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only
      his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international
      criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into
      frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought
      to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's
      motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his
      actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making
      him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
